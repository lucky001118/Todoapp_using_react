# React ToDo App
This project is a simple yet functional ToDo application built using React JS. It helps users manage their tasks by allowing them to add, mark as completed, and keep track of tasks in a visually organized manner. This app was developed to explore and demonstrate the powerful features and functionalities of React, including component-based design, state management, and conditional rendering.

# Features

Task Completion Tracking: Completed tasks automatically move to the bottom of the task list.
Real-Time Counting: Displays a continuous count of active and completed tasks for easy tracking.
Interactive UI: Seamless task interaction with simple and effective controls.
Component-Based Structure: Built entirely using React components, showcasing modular and reusable design.
State Management: Demonstrates efficient use of React's state to manage task status and list ordering.

Purpose of Development
This project was created as part of my learning journey with React JS. The goal was to deepen my understanding of React's capabilities, including state and component management, JSX, and rendering behavior. By building this application, I gained practical experience in creating interactive UIs, managing state effectively, and implementing features such as task sorting based on completion status.

# Future Improvements
Implementing local storage to save tasks across sessions.
Adding due dates and reminders for tasks.
Improving UI/UX with better styling and animations.
Incorporating filters to view tasks based on their status (e.g., active, completed).
